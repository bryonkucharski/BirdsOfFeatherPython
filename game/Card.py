class Card:
    """A class for representing standard (French) playing cards.
    Rank numbers are 0 through 12, corresponding to rank names: 'A','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','T','J','Q','K'.
    Suit numbers are 0 through 3, corresponding to suit names: 'C','H','S','D'.
    The String representation for each card will be the concatenation of a rank name with a suit name.

    It's possible to go between 4 different card representations using this class:
    (1) Card object representation
    (2) String representation
    (3) single integer representation (0 - 51)
    (4) two integer (rank, suit) representation

    Avoid the construction of new Card objects. Use the Card objects already created in ALL_CARDS, retrieving them via
    (1) dictionary STR_CARD_DICT lookup by two-character String representation
    (2) function get_card(int), or
    (3) function get_card(int rank, int suit).
